* Office Hours: 

* Hi! I'm a junior CS major from Poland. I enjoy taking long walks, playing chess, opera (on the receiving end; I couldn't sing to save my life), and reading really old literature. The study of algorithms was one of the first things that sparked my interest in CS, and I hope that I'll be able to help you appreciate this beautiful field more this semester!
